--- abstract

This document describes a header compression scheme and fragmentation functionality 
for very low bandwidth networks. These techniques are specially tailored for LPWAN (Low Power Wide Area Network) networks.

The Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) offers a great level of flexibility 
when processing the header fields. SCHC compression is based on a common static context stored in a LPWAN device and in the network. Static context means that the stored information does not change during the packet transmission. The context describes the field values and keeps information that will not be transmitted through the constrained network. 

SCHC must be used for LPWAN networks because it avoids complex resynchronization mechanisms, which are incompatible
with LPWAN characteristics. And also because in most cases, IPv6/UDP headers are reduced
to a small identifier called Rule ID. Eventhough sometimes, a SCHC compressed packet will not fit in one L2 PDU, and the SCHC fragmentation protocol will be used. The SCHC fragmentation and reassembly mechanism is used in two situations: for SCHC-compressed packets that still exceed the L2 PDU size; and for the case where the SCHC compression cannot be performed. 

This document describes the SCHC compression/decompression framework and applies it 
to IPv6/UDP headers. This document also specifies a fragmentation and reassembly mechanism that is used to support the IPv6 MTU requirement over LPWAN technologies. Fragmentation is mandatory for IPv6 datagrams that, after SCHC compression or when it has not been possible to apply such compression, still exceed the L2 maximum payload size. Similar solutions for other protocols such as CoAP will be described in separate documents.

# Introduction {#Introduction}

Header compression is mandatory to efficiently bring Internet connectivity to the node
within a LPWAN network. Some LPWAN networks properties can be exploited to get an efficient header
compression:

* Topology is star-oriented, therefore all the packets follow the same path.
  For the needs of this draft, the architecture can be summarized to Devices (Dev)
  exchanging information with LPWAN Application Server (App) through a Network Gateway (NGW). 

* Traffic flows are mostly known in advance since devices embed built-in
  applications. Contrary to computers or smartphones, new applications cannot
  be easily installed.

The Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) is defined for this environment.
SCHC uses a context where header information is kept in the header format order. This context is 
static (the values of the header fields do not change over time) avoiding 
complex resynchronization mechanisms, incompatible
with LPWAN characteristics. In most of the cases, IPv6/UDP headers are reduced
to a small context identifier. 

The SCHC header compression mechanism is independent of the specific LPWAN technology over which it will be used.

LPWAN technologies are also characterized,
among others, by a very reduced data unit and/or payload size
{{I-D.ietf-lpwan-overview}}.  However, some of these technologies
do not support layer two fragmentation, therefore the only option for
   them to support the IPv6 MTU requirement of 1280 bytes
 {{RFC2460}} is the use of a fragmentation protocol at the
adaptation layer below IPv6. 
This draft defines also a fragmentation 
functionality to support the IPv6 MTU requirement over LPWAN 
technologies. Such functionality has been designed under the assumption that data unit reordering will not happen between the entity performing fragmentation and the entity performing reassembly.

# LPWAN Architecture {#LPWAN-Archi}

LPWAN technologies have similar architectures but different terminology. We can identify different
types of entities in a typical LPWAN network, see {{Fig-LPWANarchi}}:

   o  Devices (Dev) are the end-devices or hosts (e.g. sensors,
      actuators, etc.). There can be a high density of devices per radio gateway.

   o  The Radio Gateway (RG), which is the end point of the constrained link.

   o  The Network Gateway (NGW) is the interconnection node between the Radio Gateway and the Internet.  

   o  LPWAN-AAA Server, which controls the user authentication and the
      applications. We use the term LPWAN-AAA server because we are not assuming 
      that this entity speaks RADIUS or Diameter as many/most AAA servers do, but equally we don't want to
      rule that out, as the functionality will be similar.

   o  Application Server (App)

# Static Context Header Compression

Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) avoids context synchronization,
which is the most bandwidth-consuming operation in other header compression mechanisms
such as RoHC {{RFC5795}}. Based on the fact
that the nature of data flows is highly predictable in LPWAN networks, some static
contexts may be stored on the Device (Dev). The contexts must be stored in both ends, and it can 
either be learned by a provisioning protocol or by out of band means or it can be pre-provisioned, etc. 
The way the context is learned on both sides is out of the scope of this document.

{: #Fig-archi title='Architecture'}

{{Fig-archi}} represents the architecture for compression/decompression, it is based on {{I-D.ietf-lpwan-overview}} 
terminology. The Device is sending applications flows using IPv6 or IPv6/UDP protocols. These flows are compressed by an 
Static Context Header Compression Compressor/Decompressor (SCHC C/D) to reduce headers size. The resulting
information is sent to a layer two (L2) frame to a LPWAN Radio Network (RG) which forwards 
the frame to a Network Gateway (NGW).
The NGW sends the data to an SCHC C/D for decompression which shares the same rules with the Dev. The SCHC C/D can be 
located on the Network Gateway (NGW) or in another place as long as a tunnel is established between the NGW and the SCHC C/D. 
The SCHC C/D in both sides must share the same set of Rules.
After decompression, the packet can be sent on the Internet to one
or several LPWAN Application Servers (App). 

The SCHC C/D process is bidirectional, so the same principles can be applied in the other direction.

## SCHC Rules

The main idea of the SCHC compression scheme is to send the Rule id to the other end instead 
of sending known field values. This Rule id identifies a rule that matches as much as possible the original 
packet values. When a value is known by both
ends, it is not necessary to send it through the LPWAN network. 

The context contains a list of rules (cf. {{Fig-ctxt}}). Each Rule contains itself a list of fields descriptions composed of a field identifier (FID), a field length (FL), a field position (FP), a direction indicator (DI), a target value (TV), a matching operator (MO) and a Compression/Decompression Action (CDA).

{: #Fig-ctxt title='Compression/Decompression Context'}


The Rule does not describe the original packet format which
must be known from the compressor/decompressor. The rule just describes the
compression/decompression behavior for the header fields. In the rule, the description of the header field must be performed in the format packet order.

The Rule also describes the compressed header fields which are transmitted regarding their position
in the rule which is used for data serialization on the compressor side and data deserialization on the decompressor side.

The Context describes the header fields and its values with the following entries:

* A Field ID (FID) is a unique value to define the header field.

* A Field Length (FL) is the length of the field that can be of fixed length as in IPv6 or UDP headers or variable
  length as in CoAP options. Fixed length fields shall be represented by its actual value in bits. Variable length fields shall be represented by a function or a variable. 

* A Field Position (FP) indicating if several instances of the field exist in the 
  headers which one is targeted. The default position is 1
  
* A direction indicator (DI) indicating the packet direction. Three values are possible:

  * UPLINK (Up) when the field or the value is only present in packets sent by the Dev to the App,

  * DOWNLINK (Dw) when the field or the value is only present in packet sent from the App to the Dev and 

  * BIDIRECTIONAL (Bi) when the field or the value is present either upstream or downstream. 

* A Target Value (TV) is the value used to make the comparison with
  the packet header field. The Target Value can be of any type (integer, strings,...).
  For instance, it can be a single value or a more complex structure (array, list,...), such as a JSON or a CBOR structure.

* A Matching Operator (MO) is the operator used to make the comparison between 
  the Field Value and the Target Value. The Matching Operator may require some 
  parameters. MO is only used during the compression phase.

* A Compression Decompression Action (CDA) is used to describe the compression
  and the decompression process. The CDA may require some 
  parameters, CDA are used in both compression and decompression phases. 

## Rule ID

Rule IDs are sent between both compression/decompression elements. The size 
of the Rule ID is not specified in this document, it is implementation-specific and can vary regarding the
LPWAN technology, the number of flows, among others. 

Some values in the Rule ID space are reserved for other functionalities than header 
compression as fragmentation. (See {{Frag}}). 

Rule IDs are specific to a Dev. Two Devs may use the same Rule ID for different
header compression. To identify the correct Rule ID, the SCHC C/D needs to combine the Rule ID with the Dev L2 identifier
to find the appropriate Rule.

## Packet processing

The compression/decompression process follows several steps:

* compression Rule selection: The goal is to identify which Rule(s) will be used
  to compress the packet's headers. When doing compression from Dw to Up the SCHC C/D needs to find the 
  correct Rule to be used by identifying its Dev-ID and the Rule-ID. In the Up situation, only the Rule-ID is used. 
  The next step is to choose the fields by their direction, using the 
  direction indicator (DI), so the fields that do not correspond to the appropriated DI will be excluded. 
  Next, then the fields are identified according to their field identifier (FID) and field position (FP). 
  If the field position does not correspond, then the Rule is not used and the SCHC take next Rule.
  Once the DI and the FP correspond to the header information, each field's value is then compared to the corresponding 
  target value (TV) stored in the Rule for that specific field using the matching operator (MO).
  If all the fields in the packet's header satisfy all the matching operators (MOs) of a Rule (i.e. all results are True),
  the fields of the header are then processed according to the Compression/Decompression Actions (CDAs) 
  and a compressed header is obtained. Otherwise, the next rule is tested. 
  If no eligible rule is found, then the header must be sent without compression, in which case the fragmentation process 
  must be required.

* sending: The Rule ID is sent to the other end followed by the information resulting
  from the compression of header fields, directly followed by the payload.
  The product of field compression is sent in the order expressed in the Rule for the matching
  fields. The way the Rule ID is sent depends on the specific LPWAN
  layer two technology and will be specified in a specific document and is out of the scope of this document. 
  For example, it can be either included in a Layer 2 header or sent in the first byte of
  the L2 payload. (Cf. {{Fig-FormatPckt}}). 

* decompression: In both directions, The receiver identifies the sender through its device-id
  (e.g. MAC address) and selects the appropriate Rule through the Rule ID. This
  Rule gives the compressed header format and associates these values to the header fields.
  It applies the CDA action to reconstruct the original
  header fields. The CDA application order can be different from the order given by the Rule. For instance
  Compute-\* may be applied at the end, after all the other CDAs.
  
  If after using SCHC compression and adding the payload to the L2 frame the datagram is not multiple of 8 bits, 
  padding may be used.

## Matching operators {#chap-MO}

Matching Operators (MOs) are functions used by both SCHC C/D endpoints involved in the header 
compression/decompression. They are not typed and can be applied indifferently to integer, string 
or any other data type. The result of the operation can either be True or False. MOs are defined as follows: 

* equal: A field value in a packet matches with a TV in a Rule if they are equal.

* ignore: No check is done between a field value in a packet and a TV
  in the Rule. The result of the matching is always true.

* MSB(length): A matching is obtained if the most significant bits of the length field value bits 
  of the header are equal to the TV in the rule. The MSB Matching Operator needs a parameter,
  indicating the number of bits, to proceed to the matching.
  
* match-mapping: The goal of mapping-sent is to reduce the size of a field by allocating
  a shorter value. The Target Value contains a list of values. Each value is identified by a short ID (or index). 
  This operator matches if a field value is equal to one of those target values. 
  

## Compression Decompression Actions (CDA) {#chap-CDA}

The Compression Decompression Action (CDA) describes the actions taken during
the compression of headers fields, and inversely, the action taken by the decompressor to restore
the original value.

{: #Fig-function title='Compression and Decompression Functions'}

{{Fig-function}} summarizes the basics functions defined to compress and decompress
a field. The first column gives the action's name. The second and third
columns outline the compression/decompression behavior.

Compression is done in the rule order and compressed values are sent in that order in the compressed
message. The receiver must be able to find the size of each compressed field
which can be given by the rule or may be sent with the compressed header. 

If the field is identified as being variable, then its size must be sent first using the following coding:

* If the size is between 0 and 14 bytes it is sent using 4 bits. 

* For values between 15 and 255, the first 4 bits sent are set to 1 and the size is sent using 8 bits. 

* For higher value, the first 12 bits are set to 1 and the size is sent on 2 bytes. 

### not-sent CDA

The not-sent function is generally used when the field value is specified in the rule and
therefore known by the both Compressor and Decompressor. This action is generally used with the
"equal" MO. If MO is "ignore", there is a risk to have a decompressed field
value different from the compressed field.

The compressor does not send any value in the compressed header for the field on which compression is applied.

The decompressor restores the field value with the target value stored in the matched rule.

### value-sent CDA

The value-sent action is generally used when the field value is not known by both Compressor and Decompressor.
The value is sent in the compressed message header. Both Compressor and Decompressor must know the
size of the field, either implicitly (the size is known by both sides) 
or explicitly in the compressed header
field by indicating the length. This function is generally used with the "ignore" MO.

### mapping-sent

mapping-sent is used to send a smaller index associated with the list of values
in the Target Value. This function is used together with the "match-mapping" MO.

The compressor looks on the TV to find the field value and send the corresponding index.
The decompressor uses this index to restore the field value.

The number of bits sent is the minimal size for coding all the possible indexes.

### LSB CDA

LSB action is used to avoid sending the known part of the packet field header to the other end.
This action is used together with the "MSB" MO. A length can be specified in the rule to indicate
how many bits have to be sent. If the length is not specified, the number of bits sent is the
field length minus the bits length specified in the MSB MO.

The compressor sends the "length" Least Significant Bits. The decompressor
combines the value received with the Target Value.

If this action is made on a variable length field, the remaining size in byte has to be sent before.


### DEViid, APPiid CDA

These functions are used to process respectively the Dev and the App Interface Identifiers (Deviid and Appiid) of the 
IPv6 addresses. Appiid CDA is less common since current LPWAN technologies
frames contain a single address.

The IID value may be computed from the Device ID present in the Layer 2 header. The
computation is specific for each LPWAN technology and may depend on the Device ID size.

In the downstream direction, these CDA may be used to determine the L2 addresses used by the LPWAN.

### Compute-\*

These classes of functions are used by the decompressor to compute the compressed field value based on received information. 
Compressed fields are elided during compression and reconstructed during decompression.

* compute-length: compute the length assigned to this field. For instance, regarding
  the field ID, this CDA may be used to compute IPv6 length or UDP length.

* compute-checksum: compute a checksum from the information already received by the SCHC C/D.
  This field may be used to compute UDP checksum.


# Fragmentation {#Frag}

## Overview

In LPWAN technologies, the L2 data unit size typically varies from tens to hundreds of bytes.  If the entire IPv6 datagram after applying SCHC header compression or as is fits within a single L2 data unit, the fragmentation mechanism is not used and the packet is sent. Otherwise, the datagram SHALL be broken into fragments.

LPWAN technologies impose some strict limitations on traffic, devices are sleeping most of the time and may receive data during a short period of time after transmission to preserve battery. To adapt the SCHC fragmentation to the capabilities of LPWAN technologies, it is desirable to enable optional fragment retransmission and to allow a gradation of fragment delivery reliability. This document does not make any decision with regard to which fragment delivery reliability option was used over a specific LPWAN technology.

   An important consideration is that LPWAN networks typically follow
   the star topology, and therefore data unit reordering is not expected
   in such networks.  This specification assumes that reordering will
   not happen between the entity performing fragmentation and the entity
   performing reassembly.  This assumption allows to reduce complexity
   and overhead of the fragmentation mechanism.


## Reliability options

This specification defines the following three fragment delivery reliability options:

   o  No ACK. 
   No ACK is the simplest fragment delivery reliability option.  The receiver does not generate overhead in the form of acknowledgments (ACKs).  However, this option does not enhance delivery reliability beyond that offered by the underlying LPWAN technology.   In the No ACK option, the receiver MUST NOT issue ACKs.


   o  Window mode - ACK ‚Äúalways‚Äù.    
   The Window mode - ACK "always" option provides flow control.  In
   addition, it is able to handle long bursts of lost fragments, since
   detection of such events can be done before  the end of the IPv6 packet
   transmission, as long as the window size is short enough.  However,
   such benefit comes at the expense of higher ACK overhead.
   In Window mode - ACK "always", an ACK is transmitted by the fragment
   receiver after a window of fragments have been sent.  A window of
   fragments is a subset of the full set of fragments needed to carry an
   IPv6 packet.  In this mode, the ACK informs the sender about received
   and/or missed fragments from the window of fragments.  Upon receipt
   of an ACK that informs about any lost fragments, the sender
   retransmits the lost fragments.  When an ACK is not received by the
   fragment sender, the latter retransmits a fragment, which serves as
   an ACK request.  The maximum number of ACK requests is
   MAX_ACK_REQUESTS.  The default value of MAX_ACK_REQUESTS is not
   stated in this document, and it is expected to be defined in other
   documents (e.g. technology- specific profiles).

   o  Window mode - ACK on error. 
   The Window mode - ACK on error option is suitable for links offering relatively low L2
   data unit loss probability.  This option reduces the number of ACKs
   transmitted by the fragment receiver. This may be especially beneficial in asymmetric
   scenarios, e.g. where fragmented data are sent uplink and the
   underlying LPWAN technology downlink capacity or message rate is
   lower than the uplink one.  However, if an ACK is lost, the sender
   assumes that all fragments covered by the ACK have been successfully
   delivered.  
   In Window mode - ACK on error, an ACK is transmitted by the fragment
   receiver after a window of fragments has been sent, only if at least
   one of the fragments in the window has been lost.  In this mode, the
   ACK informs the sender about received and/or missed fragments from
   the window of fragments.  Upon receipt of an ACK that informs about
   any lost fragments, the sender retransmits the lost fragments.  The
   maximum number of ACKs to be sent by the receiver for a specific
   window, denoted MAX_ACKS_PER_WINDOW, and the maximum number of fragment retries for a specific fragment, denoted MAX_FRAG_RETRIES,    are not stated in this document, and are expected to be defined in other documents (e.g. technology-specific profiles).
 
   The same reliability option MUST be used for all fragments of a
   packet.  It is up to implementers and/or representatives of the
   underlying LPWAN technology to decide which reliability option to use
   and whether the same reliability option applies to all IPv6 packets
   or not.  Note that the reliability option to be used is not
   necessarily tied to the particular characteristics of the underlying
   L2 LPWAN technology (e.g. the No ACK reliability option may be used
   on top of an L2 LPWAN technology with symmetric characteristics for
   uplink and downlink). 
  This document does not make any decision as to which fragment
   delivery reliability option(s) are supported by a specific LPWAN
   technology. 

   Examples of the different reliability options described are provided
   in Appendix A.


## Tools

This subsection describes the different tools that are used to enable the described fragmentation functionality and the different reliability options supported. Each tool has a corresponding header field format that is defined in the next subsection. The list of tools follows: 

o  Rule ID. When used for fragmentation-related functionality, the Rule ID is used in fragments and in ACKs. The Rule ID in a fragment is set to a value that indicates that the data unit being carried is a fragment. This also allows to interleave non-fragmented IPv6 datagrams with fragments that carry a larger IPv6 datagram. Rule ID may also be used to signal which reliability option is in use for the IPv6 packet being carried. Rule ID may also be used to signal the window size if multiple sizes are supported (see 5.7). In an ACK, the Rule ID signals that the message this Rule ID is prepended to is an ACK.  

o  Fragment Compressed Number (FCN).  The FCN is included in all fragments.  This field can be understood as a truncated, efficient
   representation of a larger-sized fragment number, and does not carry an absolute fragment number.  A special FCN value denotes the last fragment that carries a fragmented IPv6 packet.  In Window mode, the FCN is augmented with the W bit, which has the purpose of avoiding possible ambiguity for the receiver that might arise under certain conditions.

o  Datagram Tag (DTag). The DTag field, if present, is set to the same value for all fragments carrying the same IPv6 datagram, allows to interleave fragments that correspond to different IPv6 datagrams.

o  Message Integrity Check (MIC). It is computed by the sender over the complete packet (i.e. a SCHC compressed or an uncompressed IPv6 packet) before fragmentation. The algorithm to be used to compute the MIC is not defined in this document, and needs to be defined in other documents (e.g. technology-specific profiles).  The MIC allows the receiver to check errors in the reassembled packet, while it also enables compressing the UDP checksum by use of SCHC compression.

o  Bitmap. The bitmap is a sequence of bits included in the ACK for a given window, each bit in the Bitmap identifies a fragment. It provides feedback on whether each fragment of the current window has been received or not.

## Formats

This section defines the fragment format, the fragmentation header formats, and the ACK format.

### Fragment format

   A fragment comprises a fragmentation header and a fragment payload, and conforms
   to the format shown in {{Fig-FragFormat}}. The fragment payload carries a subset of either an
   IPv6 packet after header compression or an IPv6 packet which could not be compressed. 
   A fragment is the payload in the L2 protocol data unit (PDU).

   * Rule ID: This field has a size of R - T - N - 1 bits when Window mode is used. In No ACK mode, the Rule ID field has a size of R ‚Äì T ‚Äì N bits. 
   
   * DTag: The size of the DTag field is T bits, which may be set to a value greater than or equal to 0 bits. The DTag field in all fragments that carry the same IPv6 datagram MUST be set to the same value. DTag MUST be set sequentially increasing from 0 to 2^T - 1, and MUST wrap back from 2^T - 1 to 0.

   * FCN: This field is an unsigned integer, with a size of N bits, that carries the FCN of the fragment.  In the No ACK option, N=1.
      For the rest of options, N equal to or greater than 3 is recommended.  The FCN MUST be set sequentially decreasing from the
      highest FCN in the window (which will be used for the first fragment), and MUST wrap from 0 back to the highest FCN in the
      window.  The highest FCN in the window, denoted MAX_WIND_FCN, MUST be a value equal to or smaller than 2^N-2, see further details on this at the end of 5.5.3.  (Example 1: for N=5, MAX_WIND_FCN may be configured to be 30, then subsequent FCNs are set       sequentially and in decreasing order, and FCN will wrap from 0 back to 30.  Example 2: for N=5, MAX_WIND_FCN may be set
      to 23, then subsequent FCNs are set sequentially and in decreasing order, and the FCN will wrap from 0 back to 23).  The FCN for the last fragment has all bits set to 1.  Note that, by this definition, the FCN value of 2^N - 1 is only used to identify a
      fragment as the last fragment carrying a subset of the IPv6 packet being transported, and thus the FCN does not correspond
      to the N least significant bits of the actual absolute fragment number.  It is also important to note that, for N=1, the last
      fragment of the packet will carry a FCN equal to 1, while all previous fragments will carry a FCN of 0.
      
   * W: W is a 1-bit field. This field carries the same value for all fragments of a window, and it is complemented for the next window. The initial value for this field is 1.

   * MIC: This field, which has a size of M bits, carries the MIC for the IPv6 packet.
   
   The values for R, N, MAX_WIND_FCN, T and M are not specified in this document, and have to be determined in other documents (e.g. technology-specific profile documents).
   
### ACK format

The format of an ACK is shown in {{Fig-ACK-Format}}:

~~~~
                <--------  R  ------->
                            <- T -> 1  
                +---- ... --+-... -+-+----- ... ---+
                |  Rule ID  | DTag |W|   bitmap    |
                +---- ... --+-... -+-+----- ... ---+
~~~~
{: #Fig-ACK-Format title='Format of an ACK'}


  Rule ID: In all ACKs, Rule ID has a size of R - T - 1 bits.
   
  DTag: DTag has a size of T bits. DTag carries the same value as the DTag field in the fragments carrying the IPv6 datagram for which this ACK is intended.
  
  W: This field has a size of 1 bit. In all ACKs, the W bit carries the same value as the W bit carried by the fragments whose reception is being positively or negatively acknowledged by the ACK.
  
  bitmap: This field carries the bitmap sent by the receiver to inform the sender about whether fragments in the current window have been received or not. Size of the bitmap field of an ACK can be equal to 0 or Ceiling(Number_of_Fragments/8) octets, where Number_of_Fragments denotes the number of fragments of a window. The bitmap is a sequence of bits, where the n-th bit signals whether the n-th fragment transmitted in the current window has been correctly received (n-th bit set to 1) or not (n-th bit set to 0). Remaining bits with bit order greater than the number of fragments sent (as determined by the receiver) are set to 0, except for the last bit in the bitmap, which is set to 1 if the last fragment of the window has been correctly received, and 0 otherwise. Feedback on reception of the fragment with FCN = 2^N - 1 (last fragment carrying an IPv6 packet) is only given by the last bit of the corresponding bitmap. Absence of the bitmap in an ACK confirms correct reception of all fragments to be acknowledged by means of the ACK. Note that absence of the bitmap in an ACK may be determined based on the size of the L2 payload.
  
   
{{Fig-Bitmap-Win}} shows an example of an ACK (N=3), where the bitmap
indicates that the second and the fifth fragments have not been correctly received.

Note that, in order to exploit the available L2 payload space to the fullest, a bitmap may have a size smaller than 2^N bits. In that case, the window in use will have a size lower than 2^N-1 fragments. For example, if the maximum available space for a bitmap is 56 bits, N can be set to 6, and the window size can be set to a maximum of 56 fragments, thus MAX_WIND_FCN will be equal to 55 in this example.  

## Baseline mechanism

 The receiver needs to identify all the fragments that belong to a given IPv6 datagram. To this end, the receiver SHALL use: 
 (1) the sender's L2 source address (if present), 
 (2) the destination's L2 address (if present),
 (3) Rule ID and 
 (4) DTag (the latter, if present).  
Then, the fragment receiver may determine the fragment delivery reliability option that is used for this fragment based on the Rule ID field in that fragment.

Upon receipt of a link fragment, the receiver starts constructing the original unfragmented packet.  It uses the FCN and the order of    arrival of each fragment to determine the location of the individual fragments within the original unfragmented packet. (A fragment payload may carry bytes from a SCHC compressed IPv6 header, an uncompressed IPv6 header or an IPv6 datagram data payload. An unfragmented packet could be a SCHC compressed or an uncompressed IPv6 packet.)  For example, the receiver may place the fragment payload within a payload datagram reassembly buffer at the location determined from: the FCN, the arrival order of the fragments, and the fragment payload sizes. In Window mode, the fragment receiver also uses the W bit in the received fragments. Note that the size of the original, unfragmented packet cannot be determined from fragmentation headers.

When Window mode - ACK on error is used, the fragment receiver starts a timer (denoted "ACK on Error Timer") upon reception of the first fragment.  The initial value for this timer is not provided by this specification, and is expected to be defined in additional documents.  This timer is reset and restarted every time that a new fragment carrying data from the same datagram is received. In Window mode ‚Äì ACK on error, after reception of the last fragment of a window (i.e. the fragment with FCN=0 or FCN=2^N-1), if fragment losses have been detected by the fragment receiver in the current window, the fragment receiver MUST transmit an ACK reporting its available information with regard to successfully received and missing fragments from the current window.  Upon expiration of the ‚ÄúACK on Error Timer‚Äù, an ACK MUST be transmitted by the fragment receiver to report received and not received fragments for the current window. The ‚ÄúACK on Error Timer‚Äù is then reset and restarted. When the last fragment of the datagram is received, if all fragments of that last window of the packet have been received, the ‚ÄúACK on Error Timer‚Äù is stopped. In Window mode ‚Äì ACK on error, the fragment sender retransmits any lost fragments reported in an ACK, as long as the number of retransmissions for a specific fragment does not exceed MAX_FRAG_RETRIES. The maximum number of ACKs to be sent by the receiver for a specific window, denoted MAX_ACKS_PER_WINDOW, as well as MAX_FRAG_RETRIES, are not stated in this document, and are expected to be defined in other documents (e.g. technology-specific profiles). In Window mode ‚Äì ACK on error, when a fragment sender has transmitted the last fragment of a window, or it has retransmitted the last fragment within the set of lost fragments reported in an ACK, it is assumed that the time the fragment sender will wait to receive an ACK is smaller than the transmission time of MAX_WIND_FCN + 1 fragments (i.e. the time required to transmit a complete window of fragments). This aspect must be carefully considered if Window mode ‚Äì ACK on error is used, in particular taking into account the latency characteristics of the underlying L2 technology.

Note that, in Window mode, the first fragment of the window is the one with FCN set to MAX_WIND_FCN.  Also note that, in Window mode, the fragment with FCN=0 is considered the last fragment of its window, except for the last fragment of the whole packet (with all FCN bits set to 1, i.e. FCN=2^N-1), which is also the last fragment of the last window.

If Window mode - ACK "always" is used, upon receipt of the last fragment of a window (i.e. the fragment with CFN=0 or CFN=2^N-1), or 
upon receipt of the last retransmitted fragment from the set of lost fragments reported by the last ACK sent by the fragment receiver (if any), the fragment receiver MUST send an ACK to the fragment sender. The ACK provides feedback on the fragments received and those not received that correspond to the last window. Once all fragments of a window have been received by the fragment receiver (including retransmitted fragments, if any), the latter sends an ACK without a bitmap to the sender, in order to report successful reception of all fragments of the window to the fragment sender.

When Window mode - ACK "always" is used, the fragment sender starts a timer (denoted "ACK Always Timer") after the first transmission attempt of the last fragment of a window (i.e. the fragment with FCN=0 or FCN=2^N-1). In the same reliability option, if one or more fragments are reported by an ACK to be lost, the sender retransmits those fragments and starts the ‚ÄúACK Always Timer‚Äù after the last retransmitted fragment (i.e. the fragment with the lowest FCN) among the set of lost fragments reported by the ACK. The initial value for the ‚ÄúACK Always Timer‚Äù is not provided by this specification, and it is expected to be defined in additional documents (nevertheless, a reasonably low value for this timer is recommended, as long as the scenario permits, in order to avoid high fragmented IPv6 packet transmission delay). Upon expiration of the timer, if no ACK has been received since the timer start, the next action to be performed by the fragment sender depends on whether the current window is the last window of the packet or not. If the current window is not the last one, the sender retransmits the last fragment sent at the moment of timer expiration (which may or may not be the fragment with FCN=0), and it reinitializes and restarts the timer. Otherwise (i.e. the current window is the last one), the sender retransmits the fragment with FCN=2^N-1; if the fragment sender knows that the fragment with FCN=2^N-1 has already been successfully received, the fragment sender MAY opt to send a fragment with FCN=2^N-1 and without a data payload. Note that retransmitting a fragment sent as described serves as an ACK request. The maximum number of requests for a specific ACK, denoted MAX_ACK_REQUESTS, is not stated in this document, and it is expected to be defined in other documents (e.g. technology-specific profiles). In Window mode ‚Äì ACK ‚ÄúAlways‚Äù, the fragment sender retransmits any lost fragments reported in an ACK. When the fragment sender receives an ACK that confirms correct reception of all fragments of a window, if there are further fragments to be sent for the same IPv6 datagram, the fragment sender proceeds to transmitting subsequent fragments of the next window.

If the recipient receives the last fragment of a datagram (i.e. the fragment with FCN=2^N-1), it checks for the integrity of the reassembled datagram, based on the MIC received. In No ACK, if the integrity check indicates that the reassembled datagram does not match the original datagram (prior to fragmentation), the reassembled datagram MUST be discarded. In Window mode, a MIC check is also performed by the fragment receiver after reception of each subsequent fragment retransmitted after the first MIC check. In Window mode ‚Äì ACK ‚Äúalways‚Äù, if a MIC check indicates that the datagram has been successfully reassembled, the fragment receiver sends an ACK without a bitmap to the fragment sender. In the same reliability option, after receiving a fragment with FCN=2^N-1, the fragment receiver sends an ACK to the fragment sender, even if it is not the first fragment with FCN=2^N-1 received by the fragment receiver.

If a fragment recipient disassociates from its L2 network, the recipient MUST discard all link fragments of all partially reassembled payload datagrams, and fragment senders MUST discard all not yet transmitted link fragments of all partially transmitted payload (e.g., IPv6) datagrams. Similarly, when either end of the LPWAN link first receives a fragment of a packet, it starts a reassembly timer. When this time expires, if the entire packet has not been reassembled, the existing fragments MUST be discarded and the reassembly state MUST be flushed. The value for this timer is not provided by this specification, and is expected to be defined in technology-specific profile documents.

## Supporting multiple window sizes

For Window mode operation, implementers may opt to support a single window size or multiple window sizes. The latter, when feasible, may provide performance optimizations. For example, a large window size may be used for packets that need to be carried by a large number of fragments. However, when the number of fragments required to carry an packet is low, a smaller window size, and thus a shorter bitmap, may be sufficient to provide feedback on all fragments. If multiple window sizes are supported, the Rule ID may be used to signal the window size in use for a specific packet transmission.

## Aborting fragmented datagram transmissions

For several reasons, a fragment sender or a fragment receiver may want to abort the on-going transmission of one or several fragmented IPv6 datagrams. The entity (either the fragment sender or the fragment receiver) that triggers abortion transmits to the other endpoint a data unit with an L2 payload that only comprises a Rule ID (of size R bits), which signals abortion of all on-going fragmented packet transmissions. The specific value to be used for the Rule ID of this abortion signal is not defined in this document, and is expected to be defined in future documents.

Upon transmission or reception of the abortion signal, both entities MUST release any resources allocated for the fragmented datagram transmissions being aborted. 


## Downlink fragment transmission

In some LPWAN technologies, as part of energy-saving techniques, downlink transmission is only possible immediately after an uplink transmission. In order to avoid potentially high delay for fragmented datagram transmission in the downlink, the fragment receiver MAY perform an uplink transmission as soon as possible after reception of a fragment that is not the last one. Such uplink transmission may be triggered by the L2 (e.g. an L2 ACK sent in response to a fragment encapsulated in a L2 frame that requires an L2 ACK) or it may be triggered from an upper layer.

## Fragmentation Mode of Operation Description
The fragmentation is based on the FCN value, which has a length of N bits. The All-1 and All-0 values are reserved, and are used to control the fragmentation transmission. The FCN will be sent in downwards position this means from larger to smaller and the number of bits depends on the implementation. The last fragment in all modes must contains a MIC which is used to check if there are error or missing fragments.

### No ACK Mode
In the No ACK mode there is no possibility to communicate with the other side, so a one bit FCN is used, where FCN all-0 will be sent for all the fragments except the last one which will set FCN to all-1 and will send the MIC. {{Fig-NoACKModeSnd}} shows the state machine for the sender.

The receiver waits for fragments and will set a timer in order to see if there is no missing fragments. The No ACK will use  the last fragment to check error using the MIC and FCN is set to all-1 for this last fragment. {{Fig-NoACKModeRcv}} shows the state machine for the receiver. When the Timer expires or when the check of MIC gives an error it will abort and go to error state all the fragments will be lost. Inactivity will be based on the technology used and will be define in the specific technology document.

### The Window mode 
The jumping window protocol is using two windows alternatively 0 and 1.
A all-0 fragment allows to switch from a window to another. A all-1 indicates 
that it is the last window. 

In all cases, sender may not have to send all the fragment contained in the
window. To ease FN reconstruction from FCN, it is recommended to send  sequentially
all the fragments on a window and for all non terminating window to fill entirely the
window if the size of the bitmap the receiver will generate can be sent on a single frame.

If the bitmap cannot be sent in one frame or for the last window, first FCN should be set
to the lowest possible value. 

All-1 and All-0 fragments are set to the right-most position on the bitmap. Highest FCN 
is set to the left-most position. A bit set to 1 indicates that the corresponding FCN 
fragment has been sent (All-1 is set to All-0 position).

The Window mode has two different mode of operation: The ACK on error and the ACK always.

### ACK on error


### ACK Always
The {{Fig-ACKAlwaysSnd}} finite state machine describes the sender behavior.
Intially, when a fragmented packet is sent, the window is set to 0, a local_bit map 
is set to 0, and FCN is set the the highest possible value depending on the number
of fragment that will be sent in the window. 

The sender start sending fragment indicating in the fragmentation header, the current
window and the FCN number. A delay between each fragment can be added to respect regulation
rules or constraints imposed by the applications. This state can be leaved for different
reasons:
- the FCN reaches value 0. In that case a all-0 fragmet is sent and the sender will wait for
the bitmap acknowledged by the receiver.
- the last fragment is sent. In that case a all-1 fragment is sent and the sender will wait
for the bitmap acknowledged by the receiver.

During the transition between the sending the fragment of the current window and waiting 
for bitmap, the sender start listening to the radio and start a timer. This timer 
is dimensioned  to the receiving window depending on the LPWAN technology.

In Ack on error mode, the timer expiration will eb consider as a positive acknowledgment.
In Always Ack, if the timer expire, a empty All-0 (or All-1 if the last fragment has been sent)
fragment is sent to ask the receiver to resent its bitmap. The window number is not changed.

The sender receives a bitmap, it checks the window value. Acknowledgment with the
non expected window are discarded.

if the window number on the received bitmap is correct, the sender compare the local bitmap
with the received bitmap. If they are equal all the fragments sent during the window 
have been well received. If at least one fragment need to be sent, the sender clear 
the bitmap, stop the timer and move its sending window to the next value. If no more
fragments have to be sent, then the fragmented packet transmission is terminated.

If some fragments are missing (not set in the bit map) then the sender resend the missing
fragments. When the retransmission is finished, it start listening to the bitmap (even if
a All-0 or All-1 has not been sent during the retransmission) and returns to the 
waiting bitmap state.

{: #Fig-ACKAlwaysSnd title='Sender State Machine for the ACK Always Mode'}

The {{Fig-ACKAlwaysRcv}} finite state machine describes the receiver behavior.

The receiver start with window 0 as the expecting window and maintain a local_bitmap 
indicating which fragments it as received (all-0 and all-1 occupy the same position).

Any fragment not belonging to the current window is discarded. Fragment belonging to the 
correct window are accepted, FN is computed based on the FCN value. The receiver leaves
this state when receiving a:
- all-0 fragment which indicates that all the fragments have been sent in the current
window. Since the sender is not obliged to send a full window, some fragment number
not set in the local_bitmap may not correspond to losses.
- all-1 fragment which indicated that the transmission is finished. Since the last window
is not full, the MIC will be used to detect is all the fragment has been received.

A correct MIC indicates the end of the transmission. The receiver must stay in this state
of a period of time to answer to empty all-1 frag the sender may send if the bitmap
is lost.

If All-1 frag has not been received, the receiver expect a new window. It waits for
the next fragment. If the window value is not changing, the received fragments are
part of a retransmission. A receiver that has already receive a frag should discard it 
(not represented in the state machine), otherwise if complete its bitmap. If all the
bit of the bitmap are set to one, the receiver may send a bitmap without waiting for a 
all-0 frag. 
If the window value is set to the next value, this means that the sender as received 
a correct bitmpap  telling that all the fragments have been received. The receiver
change the value of the expected window.

If the receiver receives a all-0 it stays in the same state. Sender may send 1 fragment
per window or other fragment in the window has been lost.

If the receiver receives a all-1 this means that the transmission should be finished. 
If the MIC is incorrect some fragments have been lost.

In case of an incorrect MIC, the receivers wait for fragment belonging to the same window.

# SCHC Compression for IPv6 and UDP headers

This section lists the different IPv6 and UDP header fields and how they can be compressed.

## IPv6 version field

This field always holds the same value, therefore the TV is 6, the MO is "equal" 
and the "CDA "not-sent"".

## IPv6 Traffic class field

If the DiffServ field identified by the rest of the rule do not vary and is known 
by both sides, the TV should contain this well-known value, the MO should be "equal" 
and the CDA must be "not-sent.

If the DiffServ field identified by the rest of the rule varies over time or is not 
known by both sides, then there are two possibilities depending on the variability of the value, 
the first one is to do not compressed the field and sends the original value, or 
the second where the values can be computed by sending only the LSB bits:

* TV is not set to any value, MO is set to "ignore" and CDA is set to "value-sent"

* TV contains a stable value, MO is MSB(X) and CDA is set to LSB

## Flow label field

If the Flow Label field identified by the rest of the rule does not vary and is known 
by both sides, the TV should contain this well-known value, the MO should be "equal" 
and the CDA should be "not-sent".

If the Flow Label field identified by the rest of the rule varies during time or is not 
known by both sides, there are two possibilities depending on the variability of the value,
the first one is without compression and then the value is sent 
and the second where only part of the value is sent and the decompressor needs to compute the original value:

* TV is not set, MO is set to "ignore" and CDA is set to "value-sent"

* TV contains a stable value, MO is MSB(X) and CDA is set to LSB

## Payload Length field

If the LPWAN technology does not add padding, this field can be elided for the 
transmission on the LPWAN network. The SCHC C/D recomputes the original payload length
value. The TV is not set, the MO is set to "ignore" and the CDA is "compute-IPv6-length".

If the payload length needs to be sent and does not need to be coded in 16 bits, the TV can be set to 0x0000, 
the MO set to "MSB (16-s)" and the
CDA to "LSB". The 's' parameter depends on the expected maximum packet length.

On other cases, the payload length field must be sent and the CDA is replaced by "value-sent".

## Next Header field

If the Next Header field identified by the rest of the rule does not vary and is known 
by both sides, the TV should contain this Next Header value, the MO should be "equal" 
and the CDA should be "not-sent".

If the Next header field identified by the rest of the rule varies during time or is not 
known by both sides, then TV is not set, MO is set to "ignore" and CDA is set to 
"value-sent". A matching-list may also be used.

## Hop Limit field

The End System is generally a device and does not forward packets, therefore the
Hop Limit value is constant. So the TV is set with a default value, the MO 
is set to "equal" and the CDA is set to "not-sent".

Otherwise the value is sent on the LPWAN: TV is not set, MO is set to ignore and 
CDA is set to "value-sent".

Note that the field behavior differs in upstream and downstream. In upstream, since there is 
no IP forwarding between the Dev and the SCHC C/D, the value is relatively constant. On the
other hand, the downstream value depends of Internet routing and may change more frequently.
One solution could be to use the Direction Indicator (DI) to distinguish both directions to
elide the field in the upstream direction and send the value in the downstream direction.

## IPv6 addresses fields

As in 6LoWPAN {{RFC4944}}, IPv6 addresses are split into two 64-bit long fields; 
one for the prefix and one for the Interface Identifier (IID). These fields should
be compressed. To allow a single rule, these values are identified by their role 
(DEV or APP) and not by their position in the frame (source or destination). The SCHC C/D
must be aware of the traffic direction (upstream, downstream) to select the appropriate
field.

### IPv6 source and destination prefixes

Both ends must be synchronized with the appropriate prefixes. For a specific flow, 
the source and destination prefix can be unique and stored in the context. It can 
be either a link-local prefix or a global prefix. In that case, the TV for the 
source and destination prefixes contains the values, the MO is set to "equal" and
the CDA is set to "not-sent".

In case the rule allows several prefixes, mapping-list must be used. The 
different prefixes are listed in the TV associated with a short ID. The MO is set 
to "match-mapping" and the CDA is set to "mapping-sent".

Otherwise the TV contains the prefix, the MO is set to "equal" and the CDA is set to
value-sent.

### IPv6 source and destination IID

If the DEV or APP IID are based on an LPWAN address, then the IID can be reconstructed 
with information coming from the LPWAN header. In that case, the TV is not set, the MO 
is set to "ignore" and the CDA is set to "DEViid" or "APPiid". Note that the 
LPWAN technology is generally carrying a single device identifier corresponding
to the DEV. The SCHC C/D may also not be aware of these values. 

If the DEV address has a static value that is not derived from an IEEE EUI-64,
then TV contains the actual Dev address value, the MO operator is set to
"equal" and the CDA is set to "not-sent". 

If several IIDs are possible, then the TV contains the list of possible IIDs, the MO is 
set to "match-mapping" and the CDA is set to "mapping-sent". 

Otherwise the value variation of the IID may be reduced to few bytes. In that case, the TV is
set to the stable part of the IID, the MO is set to MSB and the CDA is set to LSB.

Finally, the IID can be sent on the LPWAN. In that case, the TV is not set, the MO is set
to "ignore" and the CDA is set to "value-sent".

## IPv6 extensions

No extension rules are currently defined. They can be based on the MOs and 
CDAs described above.

## UDP source and destination port

To allow a single rule, the UDP port values are identified by their role 
(DEV or APP) and not by their position in the frame (source or destination). The SCHC C/D
must be aware of the traffic direction (upstream, downstream) to select the appropriate
field. The following rules apply for DEV and APP port numbers.

If both ends know the port number, it can be elided. The TV contains the port number,
the MO is set to "equal" and the CDA is set to "not-sent".

If the port variation is on few bits, the TV contains the stable part of the port number,
the MO is set to "MSB" and the CDA is set to "LSB".

If some well-known values are used,  the TV can contain the list of this values, the
MO is set to "match-mapping" and the CDA is set to "mapping-sent".

Otherwise the port numbers are sent on the LPWAN. The TV is not set, the MO is 
set to "ignore" and the CDA is set to "value-sent".

## UDP length field

If the LPWAN technology does not introduce padding, the UDP length can be computed
from the received data. In that case the TV is not set, the MO is set to "ignore" and
the CDA is set to "compute-UDP-length".

If the payload is small, the TV can be set to 0x0000, the MO set to "MSB" and the
CDA to "LSB". 

On other cases, the length must be sent and the CDA is replaced by "value-sent".

## UDP Checksum field

IPv6 mandates a checksum in the protocol above IP. Nevertheless, if a more efficient
mechanism such as L2 CRC or MIC is carried by or over the L2 (such as in the 
LPWAN fragmentation process (see section {{Frag}})), the UDP checksum transmission can be avoided.
In that case, the TV is not set, the MO is set to "ignore" and the CDA is set to
"compute-UDP-checksum".

In other cases the checksum must be explicitly sent. The TV is not set, the MO is set to
"ignore" and the CDF is set to "value-sent".

# Security considerations

## Security considerations for header compression
A malicious header compression could cause the reconstruction of a 
wrong packet that does not match with the original one, such corruption 
may be detected with end-to-end authentication and integrity mechanisms. 
Denial of Service may be produced but its arise other security problems 
that may be solved with or without header compression.

## Security considerations for fragmentation
This subsection describes potential attacks to LPWAN fragmentation 
and suggests possible countermeasures.

A node can perform a buffer reservation attack by sending a first
fragment to a target.  Then, the receiver will reserve buffer space
for the IPv6 packet.  Other incoming fragmented packets will be
dropped while the reassembly buffer is occupied during the reassembly
timeout.  Once that timeout expires, the attacker can repeat the same
procedure, and iterate, thus creating a denial of service attack.
The (low) cost to mount this attack is linear with the number of
buffers at the target node.  However, the cost for an attacker can be
increased if individual fragments of multiple packets can be stored
in the reassembly buffer.  To further increase the attack cost, the
reassembly buffer can be split into fragment-sized buffer slots.
Once a packet is complete, it is processed normally.  If buffer
overload occurs, a receiver can discard packets based on the sender
behavior, which may help identify which fragments have been sent by
an attacker.

In another type of attack, the malicious node is required to have
overhearing capabilities.  If an attacker can overhear a fragment, it
can send a spoofed duplicate (e.g. with random payload) to the
destination. If the LPWAN technology does not support suitable protection 
(e.g. source authentication and frame counters to prevent replay attacks), 
a receiver cannot distinguish legitimate from spoofed fragments.  Therefore, 
the original IPv6 packet will be considered corrupt and will be dropped.
To protect resource-constrained nodes from this attack, it has been proposed
to establish a binding among the fragments to be transmitted by a node, 
by applying content-chaining to the different fragments, based on cryptographic
hash functionality.  The aim of this technique is to allow a receiver to
identify illegitimate fragments.

Further attacks may involve sending overlapped fragments (i.e.
comprising some overlapping parts of the original IPv6 datagram).
Implementers should make sure that correct operation is not affected
by such event.

In Window mode ‚Äì ACK on error, a malicious node may force a fragment sender to resend a fragment a number of times, with the aim to increase consumption of the fragment sender‚Äôs resources. To this end, the malicious node may repeatedly send a fake ACK to the fragment sender, with a bitmap that reports that one or more fragments have been lost. In order to mitigate this possible attack, MAX_FRAG_RETRIES may be set to a safe value which allows to limit the maximum damage of the attack to an acceptable extent. However, note that a high setting for MAX_FRAG_RETRIES benefits fragment delivery reliability, therefore the trade-off needs to be carefully considered.

# SCHC Compression Examples {#compressIPv6}


This section gives some scenarios of the compression mechanism for IPv6/UDP.
The goal is to illustrate the SCHC behavior.

The most common case using the mechanisms defined in this document will be a 
LPWAN Dev that embeds some applications running over
CoAP. In this example, three flows are considered. The first flow is for the device management based
on CoAP using
Link Local IPv6 addresses and UDP ports 123 and 124 for Dev and App, respectively.
The second flow will be a CoAP server for measurements done by the Device
(using ports 5683) and Global IPv6 Address prefixes alpha::IID/64 to beta::1/64.
The last flow is for legacy applications using different ports numbers, the
destination IPv6 address prefix is gamma::1/64.

 {{FigStack}} presents the protocol stack for this Device. IPv6 and UDP are represented
with dotted lines since these protocols are compressed on the radio link.

Note that in some LPWAN technologies, only the Devs have a device ID.
Therefore, when such technologies are used, it is necessary to define statically an IID for the Link
Local address for the SCHC C/D.

{: #Fig-fields title='Context rules'}

All the fields described in the three rules depicted on {{Fig-fields}} are present
in the IPv6 and UDP headers.  The DEViid-DID value is found in the L2
header.

The second and third rules use global addresses. The way the Dev learns the
prefix is not in the scope of the document. 

The third rule compresses port numbers to 4 bits. 


# Fragmentation Examples

This section provides examples of different fragment delivery reliability options possible on the basis of this specification.

{{Fig-Example-Unreliable}} illustrates the transmission of an IPv6 packet that needs 11 fragments in the No ACK option, FCN is always 1 bit.

# Allocation of Rule IDs for fragmentation

A set of Rule IDs are allocated to support different aspects of fragmentation functionality as per this document. The allocation of IDs is to be defined in other documents. The set MAY include:   

   *  one ID or a subset of IDs to identify a fragment as well as its reliability option and its window size, if multiple of these are supported.
   
   *  one ID to identify the ACK message.
   
   *  one ID to identify the Abort message as per Section 9.8.
