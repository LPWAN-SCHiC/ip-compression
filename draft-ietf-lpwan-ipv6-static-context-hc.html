  <p class="title">LPWAN Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) and fragmentation for IPv6 and UDP<br />
  <span class="filename">draft-ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc-07</span></p>
  
  <h1 id="rfc.abstract"><a href="#rfc.abstract">Abstract</a></h1>
<p>This document describes a header compression scheme and fragmentation functionality for very low bandwidth networks. These techniques are specially tailored for LPWAN (Low Power Wide Area Network) networks.</p>
<p>The Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) offers a great level of flexibility when processing the header fields. SCHC compression is based on a common static context stored in a LPWAN device and in the network. Static context means that the stored information does not change during the packet transmission. The context describes the field values and keeps information that will not be transmitted through the constrained network.</p>
<p>SCHC must be used for LPWAN networks because it avoids complex resynchronization mechanisms, which are incompatible with LPWAN characteristics. And also because in most cases, IPv6/UDP headers are reduced to a small identifier called Rule ID. Eventhough sometimes, a SCHC compressed packet will not fit in one L2 PDU, and the SCHC fragmentation protocol will be used. The SCHC fragmentation and reassembly mechanism is used in two situations: for SCHC-compressed packets that still exceed the L2 PDU size; and for the case where the SCHC compression cannot be performed.</p>
<p>This document describes the SCHC compression/decompression framework and applies it to IPv6/UDP headers. This document also specifies a fragmentation and reassembly mechanism that is used to support the IPv6 MTU requirement over LPWAN technologies. Fragmentation is mandatory for IPv6 datagrams that, after SCHC compression or when it has not been possible to apply such compression, still exceed the L2 maximum payload size. Similar solutions for other protocols such as CoAP will be described in separate documents.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">Header compression is mandatory to efficiently bring Internet connectivity to the node within a LPWAN network. Some LPWAN networks properties can be exploited to get an efficient header compression:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Topology is star-oriented, therefore all the packets follow the same path.  For the needs of this draft, the architecture can be summarized to Devices (Dev) exchanging information with LPWAN Application Server (App) through a Network Gateway (NGW).</li>
<li>Traffic flows are mostly known in advance since devices embed built-in applications. Contrary to computers or smartphones, new applications cannot be easily installed.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">The Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) is defined for this environment.  SCHC uses a context where header information is kept in the header format order. This context is static (the values of the header fields do not change over time) avoiding complex resynchronization mechanisms, incompatible with LPWAN characteristics. In most of the cases, IPv6/UDP headers are reduced to a small context identifier.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">The SCHC header compression mechanism is independent of the specific LPWAN technology over which it will be used.</p>

<p class="figure">Figure 2: Architecture</p>

The Device is sending applications flows using IPv6 or IPv6/UDP protocols. These flows are compressed by an Static Context Header Compression Compressor/Decompressor (SCHC C/D) to reduce headers size. The resulting information is sent to a layer two (L2) frame to a LPWAN Radio Network (RG) which forwards the frame to a Network Gateway (NGW).  The NGW sends the data to an SCHC C/D for decompression which shares the same rules with the Dev. The SCHC C/D can be located on the Network Gateway (NGW) or in another place as long as a tunnel is established between the NGW and the SCHC C/D.  The SCHC C/D in both sides must share the same set of Rules.  After decompression, the packet can be sent on the Internet to one or several LPWAN Application Servers (App).</p>

<li>A Field Position (FP) indicating if several instances of the field exist in the headers which one is targeted. The default position is 1</li>
<li>A direction indicator (DI) indicating the packet direction. Three values are possible:  <ul>
<li>UPLINK (Up) when the field or the value is only present in packets sent by the Dev to the App,</li>
<li>DOWNLINK (Dw) when the field or the value is only present in packet sent from the App to the Dev and</li>
<li>BIDIRECTIONAL (Bi) when the field or the value is present either upstream or downstream.</li>
</ul>

<li>A Target Value (TV) is the value used to make the comparison with the packet header field. The Target Value can be of any type (integer, strings,&#8230;).  For instance, it can be a single value or a more complex structure (array, list,&#8230;), such as a JSON or a CBOR structure.</li>
<li>A Matching Operator (MO) is the operator used to make the comparison between the Field Value and the Target Value. The Matching Operator may require some parameters. MO is only used during the compression phase.</li>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.1">The compression/decompression process follows several steps:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>compression Rule selection: The goal is to identify which Rule(s) will be used to compress the packet&#8217;s headers. When doing compression from Dw to Up the SCHC C/D needs to find the correct Rule to be used by identifying its Dev-ID and the Rule-ID. In the Up situation, only the Rule-ID is used.  The next step is to choose the fields by their direction, using the direction indicator (DI), so the fields that do not correspond to the appropriated DI will be excluded.  Next, then the fields are identified according to their field identifier (FID) and field position (FP).  If the field position does not correspond, then the Rule is not used and the SCHC take next Rule.  Once the DI and the FP correspond to the header information, each field&#8217;s value is then compared to the corresponding target value (TV) stored in the Rule for that specific field using the matching operator (MO).  If all the fields in the packet&#8217;s header satisfy all the matching operators (MOs) of a Rule (i.e. all results are True), the fields of the header are then processed according to the Compression/Decompression Actions (CDAs) and a compressed header is obtained. Otherwise, the next rule is tested.  If no eligible rule is found, then the header must be sent without compression, in which case the fragmentation process must be required.</li>
<li>sending: The Rule ID is sent to the other end followed by the information resulting from the compression of header fields, directly followed by the payload.  The product of field compression is sent in the order expressed in the Rule for the matching fields. The way the Rule ID is sent depends on the specific LPWAN layer two technology and will be specified in a specific document and is out of the scope of this document.  For example, it can be either included in a Layer 2 header or sent in the first byte of the L2 payload. (Cf. <a href="#Fig-FormatPckt" class="xref">Figure 4</a>).</li>
<li>decompression: In both directions, The receiver identifies the sender through its device-id (e.g. MAC address) and selects the appropriate Rule through the Rule ID. This Rule gives the compressed header format and associates these values to the header fields.  It applies the CDA action to reconstruct the original header fields. The CDA application order can be different from the order given by the Rule. For instance Compute-* may be applied at the end, after all the other CDAs.  <br><br> If after using SCHC compression and adding the payload to the L2 frame the datagram is not multiple of 8 bits, padding may be used.</li>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>equal: A field value in a packet matches with a TV in a Rule if they are equal.</li>
<li>ignore: No check is done between a field value in a packet and a TV in the Rule. The result of the matching is always true.</li>
<li>MSB(length): A matching is obtained if the most significant bits of the length field value bits of the header are equal to the TV in the rule. The MSB Matching Operator needs a parameter, indicating the number of bits, to proceed to the matching.</li>
<li>match-mapping: The goal of mapping-sent is to reduce the size of a field by allocating a shorter value. The Target Value contains a list of values. Each value is identified by a short ID (or index).  This operator matches if a field value is equal to one of those target values.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.1">In LPWAN technologies, the L2 data unit size typically varies from tens to hundreds of bytes.  If the entire IPv6 datagram after applying SCHC header compression or when SCHC is not possible, fits within a single L2 data unit, the fragmentation mechanism is not used and the packet is sent. Otherwise, the datagram SHALL be broken into fragments.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.2">LPWAN technologies impose some strict limitations on traffic, devices are sleeping most of the time and may receive data during a short period of time after transmission to preserve battery. To adapt the SCHC fragmentation to the capabilities of LPWAN technologies, it is desirable to enable optional fragment retransmission and to allow a gradation of fragment delivery reliability. This document does not make any decision with regard to which fragment delivery reliability option may be used over a specific LPWAN technology.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.3">An important consideration is that LPWAN networks typically follow the star topology, and therefore data unit reordering is not expected in such networks.  This specification assumes that reordering will not happen between the entity performing fragmentation and the entity performing reassembly.  This assumption allows to reduce complexity and overhead of the fragmentation mechanism.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.5.2">5.2.</a> <a href="#reliability-options" id="reliability-options">Reliability options</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.1">This specification defines the following three fragment delivery reliability options:</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.2">o  No ACK.  No ACK is the simplest fragment delivery reliability option. The receiver does not generate overhead in the form of acknowledgments (ACKs).  However, this option does not enhance delivery reliability beyond that offered by the underlying LPWAN technology. In the No ACK option, the receiver MUST NOT issue ACKs.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.3">o  Window mode - ACK always (ACK-always).  <br> The ACK-always option provides flow control.  In addition, it is able to handle long bursts of lost fragments, since detection of such events can be done before  the end of the IPv6 packet transmission, as long as the window size is short enough.  However, such benefit comes at the expense of ACK use.  In ACK-always, an ACK is transmitted by the fragment receiver after a window of fragments have been sent.  A window of fragments is a subset of the full set of fragments needed to carry an IPv6 packet.  In this mode, the ACK informs the sender about received and/or missed fragments from the window of fragments.  Upon receipt of an ACK that informs about any lost fragments, the sender retransmits the lost fragments.  When an ACK is not received by the fragment sender, the latter retransmits an all-1 empty fragment, which serves as an ACK request.  The maximum number of ACK requests is MAX_ACK_REQUESTS.  The default value of MAX_ACK_REQUESTS is not stated in this document, and it is expected to be defined in other documents (e.g. technology- specific profiles).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.4">o  Window mode - ACK-on-error.  The ACK-on-error option is suitable for links offering relatively low L2 data unit loss probability.  This option reduces the number of ACKs transmitted by the fragment receiver. This may be especially beneficial in asymmetric scenarios, e.g. where fragmented data are sent uplink and the underlying LPWAN technology downlink capacity or message rate is lower than the uplink one.  However, if an ACK is lost, the sender assumes that all fragments covered by the ACK have been successfully delivered. And the receiver will abort the fragmentation.<br> In ACK-on-error, an ACK is transmitted by the fragment receiver after a window of fragments has been sent, only if at least one of the fragments in the window has been lost. In this mode, the ACK informs the sender about received and/or missed fragments from the window of fragments. Upon receipt of an ACK that informs about any lost fragments, the sender retransmits the lost fragments.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.5">The same reliability option MUST be used for all fragments of a packet.  It is up to implementers and/or representatives of the underlying LPWAN technology to decide which reliability option to use and whether the same reliability option applies to all IPv6 packets or not.  Note that the reliability option to be used is not necessarily tied to the particular characteristics of the underlying L2 LPWAN technology (e.g. the No ACK reliability option may be used on top of an L2 LPWAN technology with symmetric characteristics for uplink and downlink).  <br> This document does not make any decision as to which fragment delivery reliability option(s) are supported by a specific LPWAN technology.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.6">Examples of the different reliability options described are provided in Appendix A.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.5.3">5.3.</a> <a href="#functionalities" id="functionalities">Functionalities</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.1">This subsection describes the different fields in the fragmentation header that are used to enable the described fragmentation functionalities and the different reliability options supported.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.2">o  Rule ID. The Rule ID in the fragmentation part is used to identify the fragmentation mode used, also to idenitfy fragments from ACK and Abort frames. The also allows to interleave non-fragmented IPv6 datagrams with fragments that carry a larger IPv6 datagram.  In the fragments format this field has a size of R - T - N - 1 bits when Window mode is used. In No ACK mode, the Rule ID field has a size of R &#8211; T &#8211; N bits see format section.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.3">o  Fragment Compressed Number (FCN).  The FCN is included in all fragments.  This field can be understood as a truncated, efficient representation of a larger-sized fragment number, and does not carry an absolute fragment number.  There are two reserved values used for the control of the fragmentation. The FCN value when all the bits equals 1 (all-1) denotes the last fragment of a packet.  And the FCN value when all the bits equals 0 (all-0) denotes the last fragment of the windonw in any window mode or the fragments in No ACK mode. The rest of the FCN values are used in a sequential and decreasing order, which has the purpose to avoid possible ambiguity for the receiver that might arise under certain conditions.  In the fragments, this field is an unsigned integer, with a size of N bits. In the No ACK mode it is set to 1 bit (N=1). For the other modes it is recommended to use a number of bits (N) equal to or greater than 3. The FCN MUST be set sequentially<br> decreasing from the highest FCN in the window (which will be used for the first fragment), and MUST wrap from 0 back to the highest FCN in the window.<br> &#160; The FCN for the last fragment in a window is an all-0, which indicates that the window is finished and it proceeds according to the mode in use: either an ack is sent or the next window fragments are expected when there is no error.  The FCN for the last fragment is an all-1.  It is also important to note that, for No ACK mode or N=1, the last fragment of the packet will carry a FCN equal to 1, while all previous fragments will carry a FCN of 0.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.4">o  Datagram Tag (DTag). The DTag field, if present, is set to the same value for all fragments carrying the same IPv6 datagram, allows to interleave fragments that correspond to different IPv6 datagrams.  In the fragment formats the size of the DTag field is T bits, which may be set to a value greater than or equal to 0 bits.  DTag MUST be set sequentially increasing from 0 to 2^T - 1, and MUST wrap back from 2^T - 1 to 0.  In the ACK format, DTag carries the same value as the DTag field in the fragments for which this ACK is intended.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.5">o  W (window): W is a 1-bit field. This field carries the same value for all fragments of a window, and it is complemented for the next window. The initial value for this field is 0.  In the ACK format, this field has a size of 1 bit. In all ACKs, the W bit carries the same value as the W bit carried by the fragments whose reception is being positively or negatively acknowledged by the ACK.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.6">o  Message Integrity Check (MIC). This field, which has a size of M bits. It is computed by the sender over the complete packet (i.e. a SCHC compressed or an uncompressed IPv6 packet) before fragmentation. The algorithm to be used to compute the MIC is not defined in this document, and needs to be defined in other documents (e.g. technology-specific profiles).  The MIC allows the receiver to check errors in the reassembled packet, while it also enables compressing the UDP checksum by use of SCHC compression.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.7">o  Bitmap. The bitmap is a sequence of bits included in the ACK for a given window, each bit in the Bitmap identifies a fragment. It provides feedback on whether each fragment of the current window has been received or not.  FCN set to All-0 and All-1 fragments are set to the right-most position on the bitmap in this order. Highest FCN is set to the left-most position. A bit set to 1 indicates that the corresponding FCN fragment has been correctly sent and received.  TODO (it is missing to explain the optimization of bitmap in order to have a way to send an abort)</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.5.p.1">The receiver needs to identify all the fragments that belong to a given IPv6 datagram. To this end, the receiver SHALL use: * The sender&#8217;s L2 source address (if present), * The destination&#8217;s L2 address (if present), * Rule ID and * DTag (the latter, if present).<br> Then, the fragment receiver may determine the fragment delivery reliability option that is used for this fragment based on the Rule ID field in that fragment.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.p.2">Upon receipt of a link fragment, the receiver starts constructing the original unfragmented packet.  It uses the FCN and the order of    arrival of each fragment to determine the location of the individual fragments within the original unfragmented packet. A fragment payload may carry bytes from a SCHC compressed IPv6 header, an uncompressed IPv6 header or an IPv6 datagram data payload. An unfragmented packet could be a SCHC compressed or an uncompressed IPv6 packet (header and data).  For example, the receiver may place the fragment payload within a payload datagram reassembly buffer at the location determined from: the FCN, the arrival order of the fragments, and the fragment payload sizes. In Window mode, the fragment receiver also uses the W bit in the received fragments. Note that the size of the original, unfragmented packet cannot be determined from fragmentation headers.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.p.3">Note that, in Window mode, the first fragment of the window is the one with FCN set to MAX_WIND_FCN.  Also note that, in Window mode, the fragment with all-0 is considered the last fragment of its window, except for the last fragment of the whole packet (all-1), which is also the last fragment of the last window.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.p.4">If the recipient receives the last fragment of a datagram (all-1), it checks for the integrity of the reassembled datagram, based on the MIC received. In No ACK, if the integrity check indicates that the reassembled datagram does not match the original datagram (prior to fragmentation), the reassembled datagram MUST be discarded. In Window mode, a MIC check is also performed by the fragment receiver after reception of each subsequent fragment retransmitted after the first MIC check. In ACK always, if a MIC check indicates that the datagram has been successfully reassembled, the fragment receiver sends an ACK without a bitmap to the fragment sender.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.p.5">If a fragment recipient disassociates from its L2 network, the recipient MUST discard all link fragments of all partially reassembled payload datagrams, and fragment senders MUST discard all not yet transmitted link fragments of all partially transmitted payload (e.g., IPv6) datagrams. Similarly, when either end of the LPWAN link first receives a fragment of a packet, it starts a reassembly timer. When this time expires, if the entire packet has not been reassembled, the existing fragments MUST be discarded and the reassembly state MUST be flushed. The value for this timer is not provided by this specification, and is expected to be defined in technology-specific profile documents.</p>

However, when the number of fragments required to carry an packet is low, a smaller window size, and thus a shorter bitmap, may be sufficient to provide feedback on all fragments.

<p id="rfc.section.5.9.2.p.1">The jumping window protocol is using two windows alternatively 0 and 1.  The FCN to all-0 fragment means that the window is over and allows to switch from one window to another. The FCN to all-1 fragment indicates that it is the last fragment and there will not be another window.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.2.p.2">In all the cases, the sender may not have to send all the fragments contained in the window. To ease FN (fragment number) reconstruction from FCN, it is recommended to send sequentially all the fragments on a window and for all non-terminating window to fill entirely the window.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.2.p.3">The receiver generates the bitmap which may have the size of a single frame based on the size of downlink frame of the LPWAN technology used. When the bitmap cannot be sent in one frame or for the last window,</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.9.3.p.2">The sender starts sending fragments (SEND STATE), the sender will indicate in the fragmentation header: the current window and the FCN number. A delay between each fragment can be added to respect regulation rules or constraints imposed by the applications.

<li>The FCN reaches value 0 and there are more fragments. In that case an all-0 fragmet is sent and the timer is set. The sender will wait for the bitmap acknowledged by the receiver.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.5.9.4.p.10">Unlike the sender, the receiver for ACK on error has some differences. First we are not sending the bitmap unless there is an error or an unexpected behavior. The <a href="#Fig-ACKonerrorRcv" class="xref">Figure 24</a> finite state machine describes the receiver behavior. The receiver starts with an the expecting window and maintain a local_bitmap indicating which fragments it has received (all-0 and all-1 occupy the same position).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.4.p.11">Any fragment not belonging to the current window is discarded. Fragment belonging to the correct window are accepted, FN is computed based on the FCN value.  When an All-0 fragment is received and the bitmap is full the receiver changes the window value and clear the bitmap. The receiver leaves this state when receiving a:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>All-0 fragment and not a full bitmap indicate that all the fragments have been sent in the current window. Since the sender is not obliged to send a full window, some fragment number not set in the local_bitmap may not correspond to losses. As the receiver does not know if the missing fragments are looses or normal missing fragments it sned s a local bitmap.</li>
<li>All-1 fragment which indicates that the transmission is finished. Since the last window is not full, the MIC will be used to detect if all the fragments have been received. A correct MIC indicates the end of the transmission.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.4.p.13">If All-1 frag has not been received, the receiver expect a new window. It waits for the next fragment. If the window value has not changed, the received fragments are part of a retransmission. A receiver that has already received a frag should discard it (not represented in the state machine), otherwise it completes its bitmap. If all the bits of the bitmap are set to one, the receiver clear the bitmap and wait for the next window without waiting for a all-0 frag.  While the receiver waits for next window and if the window value is set to the next value, and all-1 fragment with the next value window arrived the receiver goes to error and abort the transmission, it drops the fragments.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.4.p.14">If the receiver receives an all-0 fragment, it stays in the same state. Sender may send more one fragment per window or more. Otherwise some fragments in the window have been lost.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.9.4.p.15">If the receiver receives an all-1 fragment this means that the transmission should be finished.  If the MIC is incorrect some fragments have been lost. It sends its bitmap.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.7.2">7.2.</a> <a href="#security-considerations-for-fragmentation" id="security-considerations-for-fragmentation">Security considerations for fragmentation</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.1">This subsection describes potential attacks to LPWAN fragmentation and suggests possible countermeasures.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.2">A node can perform a buffer reservation attack by sending a first fragment to a target.  Then, the receiver will reserve buffer space for the IPv6 packet.  Other incoming fragmented packets will be dropped while the reassembly buffer is occupied during the reassembly timeout.  Once that timeout expires, the attacker can repeat the same procedure, and iterate, thus creating a denial of service attack.  The (low) cost to mount this attack is linear with the number of buffers at the target node.  However, the cost for an attacker can be increased if individual fragments of multiple packets can be stored in the reassembly buffer.  To further increase the attack cost, the reassembly buffer can be split into fragment-sized buffer slots.  Once a packet is complete, it is processed normally.  If buffer overload occurs, a receiver can discard packets based on the sender behavior, which may help identify which fragments have been sent by an attacker.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.3">In another type of attack, the malicious node is required to have overhearing capabilities.  If an attacker can overhear a fragment, it can send a spoofed duplicate (e.g. with random payload) to the destination. If the LPWAN technology does not support suitable protection (e.g. source authentication and frame counters to prevent replay attacks), a receiver cannot distinguish legitimate from spoofed fragments.  Therefore, the original IPv6 packet will be considered corrupt and will be dropped.  To protect resource-constrained nodes from this attack, it has been proposed to establish a binding among the fragments to be transmitted by a node, by applying content-chaining to the different fragments, based on cryptographic hash functionality.  The aim of this technique is to allow a receiver to identify illegitimate fragments.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.4">Further attacks may involve sending overlapped fragments (i.e.  comprising some overlapping parts of the original IPv6 datagram).  Implementers should make sure that correct operation is not affected by such event.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.5">In Window mode &#8211; ACK on error, a malicious node may force a fragment sender to resend a fragment a number of times, with the aim to increase consumption of the fragment sender&#8217;s resources. To this end, the malicious node may repeatedly send a fake ACK to the fragment sender, with a bitmap that reports that one or more fragments have been lost. In order to mitigate this possible attack, MAX_FRAG_RETRIES may be set to a safe value which allows to limit the maximum damage of the attack to an acceptable extent. However, note that a high setting for MAX_FRAG_RETRIES benefits fragment delivery reliability, therefore the trade-off needs to be carefully considered.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.1">This section gives some scenarios of the compression mechanism for IPv6/UDP.  The goal is to illustrate the SCHC behavior.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.2">The most common case using the mechanisms defined in this document will be a LPWAN Dev that embeds some applications running over CoAP. In this example, three flows are considered. The first flow is for the device management based on CoAP using Link Local IPv6 addresses and UDP ports 123 and 124 for Dev and App, respectively.  The second flow will be a CoAP server for measurements done by the Device (using ports 5683) and Global IPv6 Address prefixes alpha::IID/64 to beta::1/64.  The last flow is for legacy applications using different ports numbers, the destination IPv6 address prefix is gamma::1/64.</p>
<p><a href="#FigStack" class="xref">Figure 25</a> presents the protocol stack for this Device. IPv6 and UDP are represented with dotted lines since these protocols are compressed on the radio link.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig-Example-Rel-Window-ACK-Loss-Last-C" class="xref">Figure 34</a> illustrates the transmission of an IPv6 packet that needs 6 fragments in Window mode - ACK &#8220;always&#8221;, for N=3 and MAX_WIND_FCN=6, with three losses, and one retransmitted fragment is lost.

Note also that the FCN of the last fragment of the packet is the one with FCN=31 (i.e. FCN=2^N-1 for N=5, or equivalently, all FCN bits set to 1).</p>
